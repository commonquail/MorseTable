# MorseTable (Android)

This is an Android 2.1 app intended for learning basic Morse code, using a graphical table representation as seen on [the Wikipedia Morse code article][wiki]. All it does now is translate the pressed letter to Morse code; not even worthy of a *Features* section.

## Planned features
* A prettier `dit` character, maybe also `dah`.
* UI refinements, including borders and letter cell highlighting.
* Simple Morse input for reverse translation.
* Better handling of Morse code (hardcoding is a pain but probably yields better performance).

Assuming I ever get around to any of it.

## Project statement

This being the result of having too much time one afternoon and deciding to try my hands at Android development, this is not meant to be a "serious" project. It is what it is and it may or may never progress. That said, it is not intended for mastering Morse code; there are numerous apps that do this
better. Nor will it be a full-fledged translator; there are numerous apps that do that better, too.
