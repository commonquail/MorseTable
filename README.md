# MorseTable (Android)

This is an Android 2.1 app intended for learning basic Morse code, using a graphical tree representation as seen on [the Wikipedia Morse code article][wiki]. All it does now is translate the pressed letter to Morse code; not even worthy of a *Features* section.

## Planned features
* Simple Morse input for reverse translation.
* Show/hide characters.
* More extensive localisation of keys.

If I ever get around to it.

## Project statement

This being the result of having too much time one afternoon and deciding to try my hands at Android development, this is not meant to be a "serious" project. It is what it is and it may or may never progress. That said, it is not intended for mastering Morse code; there are numerous apps that do this
better. Nor will it be a full-fledged translator; there are numerous apps that do that better, too.
